    <heading>Liability</heading>
    <text>Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination or reduce the personal representative's duty to protect property subject to such representative's control, to account for such property and to deliver such property to the special administrator or successor representative. Termination does not affect the personal jurisdiction consented to pursuant to section 20-501 in proceedings which may be commenced against such representative arising out of the performance of duties as personal representative. If the personal representative fails to account for and deliver the property belonging to the estate to the successor personal representative or special administrator, as required by subsection (a), the Court may enter judgment against the personal representative and the personal representative's surety.</text>
