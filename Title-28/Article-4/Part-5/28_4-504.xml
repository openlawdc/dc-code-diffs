      <heading>UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE COMMENT</heading>
      <text>The section gives the presenting bank, after dishonor, a privilege to deal with the goods in any commercially reasonable manner pending instructions from its transferor and, if still unable to communicate with its principal after a reasonable time, a right to realize its expenditures as if foreclosing on an unpaid seller's lien (Section 2-706). The provision includes situations in which storage of goods or other action becomes commercially necessary pending receipt of any requested instructions, even if the requested instructions are later received.</text>
      <text>The "reasonable manner" referred to means one reasonable in the light of business factors and the judgment of a business man.</text>
