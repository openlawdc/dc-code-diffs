        <heading>Purposes:</heading>
        <text>To express the policy that no Act which bears evidence of carefully considered permanent regulative intention should lightly be regarded as impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation. This Act, carefully integrated and intended as a uniform codification of permanent character covering an entire "field" of law, is to be regarded as particularly resistant to implied repeal. See Pacific Wool Growers v. Draper &amp; Co., 158 Or. 1, 73 P.2d 1391 (1937).</text>
