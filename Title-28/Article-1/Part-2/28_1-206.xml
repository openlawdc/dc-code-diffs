        <heading>Purposes:</heading>
        <text>To fill the gap left by the Statute of Frauds provisions for goods (Section 2- 201), and security interests (Section 9-203). As to securities, see Section 8-113. The Uniform Sales Act covered the sale of "choses in action"; the principal gap relates to sale of the "general intangibles" defined in Article 9 (Section 9-106) and to transactions excluded from Article 9 by Section 9-104. Typical are the sale of bilateral contracts, royalty rights or the like. The informality normal to such transactions is recognized by lifting the limit for oral transactions to $5,000. In such transactions there is often no standard of practice by which to judge, and values can rise or drop without warning; troubling abuses are avoided when the dollar limit is exceeded by requiring that the subject-matter be reasonably identified in a signed writing which indicates that a contract for sale has been made at a defined or stated price. Amendments approved by the Permanent Editorial Board for Uniform Commercial Code November 4, 1995.</text>
