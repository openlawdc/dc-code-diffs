    <text>A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>The present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into;</text>

    <text>Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. Additional consideration is not nominal if:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>When the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed; or</text>
