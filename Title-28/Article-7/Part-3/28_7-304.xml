      <text><text b="True">Prior Uniform Statutory Provision:</text> Section 6, Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</text>
      <text><text b="True">Changes:</text> This section adds to existing legislation, which merely prohibits bills in a set in ordinary domestic trade, a statement of the legal effect of a lawfully issued set.</text>

        <heading>Purposes of Changes:</heading>
        <text>The statement of the legal effect of a lawfully issued set is in accord with existing commercial law relating to maritime and other overseas bills. This law has been codified in the Hague and Warsaw Conventions and in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the provisions of which would ordinarily govern in situations where bills in a set are recognized by this Article.</text>
