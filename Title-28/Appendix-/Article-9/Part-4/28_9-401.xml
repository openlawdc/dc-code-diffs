    <text>The proper place to file in order to perfect a security interest is, in all cases, in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the District. In this article, "filing officer" means said Recorder. When the collateral is timber to be cut or is minerals or the like (including oil and gas) or accounts subject to subsection (5) of section 28:9-103, or when the financing statement is filed as a fixture filing (section 28:9-313) and the collateral is goods which are or are to become fixtures, then the proper place to file in order to perfect a security interest is in the office of the Recorder of Deeds of the District where a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded.</text>
