  <heading>Release of collateral; duties of filing officer; fees.</heading>
  <text>A secured party of record may by his signed statement release all or a part of any collateral described in a filed financing statement.

Upon presentation of such a statement of release to the filing officer he shall mark the statement with the hour and date of filing and shall note the same upon the margin of the index of the filing of the financing statement. The uniform fee for filing and noting such a statement of release shall be $2.00.</text>
