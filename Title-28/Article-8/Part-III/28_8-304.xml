  <level>
    <num>(a)</num>
    <text>An indorsement may be in blank or special. An indorsement in blank includes an indorsement to bearer. A special indorsement specifies to whom a security is to be transferred or who has power to transfer it. A holder may convert a blank indorsement to a special indorsement.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(b)</num>
    <text>An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security certificate representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(c)</num>
    <text>An indorsement, whether special or in blank, does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the certificate on which it appears or, if the indorsement is on a separate document, until delivery of both the document and the certificate.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(d)</num>
    <text>If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied. However, against a transferor, a transfer is complete upon delivery and the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary indorsement supplied.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(e)</num>
    <text>An indorsement of a security certificate in bearer form may give notice of an adverse claim to the certificate, but it does not otherwise affect a right to registration that the holder possesses.</text>
  </level>
  <level>
    <num>(f)</num>
    <text>Unless otherwise agreed, a person making an indorsement assumes only the obligations provided in § 28:8-108 and not an obligation that the security will be honored by the issuer.</text>
