    <text>For the purposes of this section, the term "asset-backed security" means an asset whose value is based upon the right it gives the owner to receive distributions from the proceeds of financial assets that provide collateral for the security. The term "asset-backed security" includes an asset that gives the owner the right to receive from the collateral financial assets only the interest or other current return or only the proceeds other than interest or current return. The term "asset-backed security" does not include an asset to which § 28-4804.01 or § 28-4804.09 applies.</text>
