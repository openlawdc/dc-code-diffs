    <text>A claimant may assert a claim to the amount of a check by a communication to the obligated bank describing the check with reasonable certainty and requesting payment of the amount of the check, if (i) the claimant is the drawer or payee of a certified check or the remitter or payee of a cashier's check or teller's check, (ii) the communication contains or is accompanied by a declaration of loss of the claimant with respect to the check, (iii) the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable time to act on it before the check is paid, and (iv) the claimant provides reasonable identification if requested by the obligated bank. Delivery of a declaration of loss is a warranty of the truth of the statements made in the declaration. If a claim is asserted in compliance with this subsection, the following rules apply:</text>
    <level>
      <num>(1)</num>
      <text>The claim becomes enforceable at the later of (i) the time the claim is asserted, or (ii) the 90th day following the date of the check in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check, or the 90th day following the date of the acceptance in the case of a certified check.</text>
