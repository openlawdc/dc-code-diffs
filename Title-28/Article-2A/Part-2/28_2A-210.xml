    <text>It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the lessor use formal words, such as "warrant" or "guarantee," or that the lessor have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the lessor's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.</text>

      <text><text b="True">Purposes:</text> All of the express and implied warranties of the Article on Sales (Article 2) are included in this Article, revised to reflect the differences between a sale of goods and a lease of goods. Sections 2A-210 through 2A-216. The lease of goods is sufficiently similar to the sale of goods to justify this decision. Hawkland, <text i="True">The Impact of the Uniform Commercial Code on Equipment Leasing,</text> 1972 Ill.L.F. 446, 459-60. Many state and federal courts have reached the same conclusion.</text>
