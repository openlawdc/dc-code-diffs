      <text><text b="True">Uniform Statutory Source:</text> Section 2-501.</text>
      <text><text b="True">Changes:</text> This section, together with Section 2A-218, is derived from the provisions of Section 2-501, with changes to reflect lease terminology; however, this section omits as irrelevant to leasing practice the treatment of special property.</text>
      <text><text b="True">Purposes:</text> With respect to subsection (b) there is a certain amount of ambiguity in the reference to when goods are designated, <text i="True">e.g.,</text> when the lessor is both selling and leasing goods to the same lessee/buyer and has marked goods for delivery but has not distinguished between those related to the lease contract and those related to the sales contract. As in Section 2- 501(1)(b), this issue has been left to be resolved by the courts, case by case.</text>
