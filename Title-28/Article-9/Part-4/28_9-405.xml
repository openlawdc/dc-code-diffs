      <text>1. <text b="True">Source.</text> Former Section 9-318(2).</text>
      <text>2. <text b="True">Modification of Assigned Contract.</text> The ability of account debtors and assignors to modify assigned contracts can be important, especially in the case of government contracts and complex contractual arrangements (e.g., construction contracts) with respect to which modifications are customary. Subsections (a) and (b) provide that good-faith modifications of assigned contracts are binding against an assignee to the extent that (i) the right to payment has not been fully earned or (ii) the right to payment has been earned and notification of the assignment has not been given to the account debtor. Former Section 9-318(2) did not validate modifications of fully-performed contracts under any circumstances, whether or not notification of the assignment had been given to the account debtor. Subsection (a) protects the interests of assignees by (i) limiting the effectiveness of modifications to those made in good faith, (ii) affording the assignee with corresponding rights under the contract as modified, and (iii) recognizing that the modification may be a breach of the assignor's agreement with the assignee.</text>
      <text>3. <text b="True">Consumer Account Debtors.</text> Subsection (c) is new. It makes clear that the rules of this section are subject to other law establishing special rules for consumer account debtors.</text>
      <text>4. <text b="True">Account Debtors on Health-Care-Insurance Receivables.</text> Subsection (d) also is new. It provides that this section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. The obligation of an insurer with respect to a health-care-insurance receivable is governed by other law.</text>
