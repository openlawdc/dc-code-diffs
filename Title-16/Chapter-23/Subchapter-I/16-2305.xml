    <text>Complaints alleging delinquency or need of supervision shall be referred to the Director of Social Services, and complaints alleging neglect shall be referred to the Director of the Child and Family Services Agency, each of whom shall conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the best interests of the child or the public require that a petition be filed. If judicial action appears warranted, under intake criteria established by rule of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, the Director of Social Services, or the Director of the Agency shall recommend that a petition be filed. If the Director of Social Services, in the case of a complaint alleging delinquency or need of supervision, decides not to recommend the filing of a petition, the complainant shall have a right to have that decision reviewed by the Corporation Counsel. The Director of Social Services, in the case of a complaint alleging delinquency or need of supervision, shall notify the complainant of such right of review. Complaints alleging neglect submitted by the Agency shall be referred directly to the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia.</text>

If the Director of Social Services has refused to recommend the filing of a delinquency petition, or if the Director of the Agency has refused to recommend the filing of a neglect petition, the Corporation Counsel, on request of the complainant, shall review the facts presented and shall prepare and file a petition if he believes such action is necessary to protect the community or the interests of the child.

      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 13-277 rewrote subsec. (a) which formerly read:</text>
      <text>"(a) Complaints alleging delinquency, need of supervision, or neglect shall be referred to the Director of Social Services who shall conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the best interests of the child or the public require that a petition be filed. If judicial action appears warranted, under intake criteria established by rule of the Superior Court, the Director shall recommend that a petition be filed. If the Director decides not to recommend the filing of a petition, the complainant in a delinquency or neglect case shall have a right to have that decision reviewed by the Corporation Counsel, and the Director shall notify the complainant of such right of review. Complaints alleging neglect submitted by the Child Protective Services Division of the Department of Human Services shall be referred directly to the Corporation Counsel of the District of Columbia."</text>
      <text>and in subsec. (c) substituted "If the Director of Social Services has refused to recommend the filing of a delinquency petition, or if the Director of the Agency has refused to recommend the filing of a neglect petition" for "If the Director of Social Services has refused to recommend the filing of a delinquency or neglect petition" in the second sentence.</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 15-261, in subsec. (c), designated the existing language as par. (1), and added par. (2).</text>
