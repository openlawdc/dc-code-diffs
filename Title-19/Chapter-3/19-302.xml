        <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
        <text>D.C. Law 13-292 rewrote the section which had read:</text>
        <text>"When the intestate leaves a surviving spouse and no child, parent, grandchild, brother, or sister, or the child of a brother or sister of the intestate, the surviving spouse is entitled to the whole."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 16-79, in the section heading, substituted "spouse or domestic partner" for "spouse"; in the lead-in language, substituted "surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner" for "surviving spouse"; and, in pars. (2), (4), and (5), substituted "surviving spouse or surviving domestic partner" for "surviving spouse".</text>
