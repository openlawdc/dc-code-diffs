        <text>"(b) The Court shall collect and provide to the Commission data on the length of and reasons for each sentence imposed for crimes committed on or after August 5, 2000. The reasons should include, but are not limited to, the weight given to such factors as the background and criminal history of the offender, the nature of the offense, and the impact of the offense on the victim or community.
