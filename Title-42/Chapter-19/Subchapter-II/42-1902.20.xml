If portions of the withdrawable land were described pursuant to § 42-1902.10(d)(5), then no such portion shall be so withdrawn after the conveyance of any unit on such portion. If no such portions were described, then none of the withdrawable land shall be withdrawn after the first conveyance of any unit thereon.</text>
