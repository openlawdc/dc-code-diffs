      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 13-11 struck the phrase "a semiannual" and inserted the phrase "an annual" in its place.</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-114, in subsec. (a), substituted "Mayor" for "Administrator"; in subsec. (b), substituted "Mayor" for "Administrator" and substituted "development, repair" for "repair" in the third sentence; and added subsec. (c).</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-213 made a technical change in the enacting clause of D.C. Law 14-114, § 801(d)(2)(B), which resulted in no change in text.</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 15-105 attempted to make the same technical amendment as D.C. Law 14-213, therefore, the amendment was ineffective.</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-192 added subsec. (d).</text>
