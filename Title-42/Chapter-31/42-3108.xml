  <text>The plaintiff must establish that a drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance exists by a preponderance of the evidence.

A plaintiff is not required to make any further showing that the owner knew, or should have known, of the drug-, firearm-, or prostitution-related nuisance to obtain relief under § 42-3110 or § 42-3111.</text>
