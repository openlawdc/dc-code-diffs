      <text>D.C. Law 16-179 substituted "elderly and disabled" for "elderly".</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-192 rewrote the section which had read as follows: "This subchapter shall remain in effect until the Mayor declares that a housing crisis no longer exists pursuant to § 42-3405.12. The rights granted under § 42-3402.08 to eligible elderly and disabled tenants may not be abrogated or reduced notwithstanding such a declaration by the Mayor. The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to the conversion of housing accommodations into condominium or cooperative status which are fully vacant as of the date of application to the Mayor for a vacancy exemption. Occupancy by 1 or more employees or other occupants for security or similar nontenancy purposes shall not prevent the accommodation from qualifying for a vacancy exemption. The owner shall submit to the Mayor an application for vacancy exemption in order to qualify for this vacancy exemption. The application shall require that the owner certify that the owner is not an owner or purchaser as described in the third sentence of the second paragraph of § 42-3402.02(a), and that the owner has affirmatively sought information from any applicable former owner in order to make a truthful certification. The Mayor shall accept the owner's certification unless the Mayor has received information which tends to challenge the truthfulness of the certification."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 17-354 rewrote the section, which had read as follows: "This subchapter shall remain in effect until the Mayor declares that a housing crisis no longer exists pursuant to § 42-3405.12. The rights granted under § 42-3402.08 to eligible elderly and disabled tenants may not be abrogated or reduced notwithstanding such a declaration by the Mayor. The provisions of this subchapter shall not apply to the conversion of housing accommodations into condominium or cooperative status that are fully vacant as of the date of application to the Mayor for a vacancy exemption; provided, that this exemption shall not apply to § 42-3402.04. Occupancy by 1 or more employees or other occupants for security or similar nontenancy purposes shall not prevent the accommodation from qualifying for a vacancy exemption. The owner shall submit to the Mayor an application for vacancy exemption in order to qualify for this vacancy exemption. The application shall require that the owner certify that the owner is not an owner or purchaser as described in the third sentence of the second paragraph of § 42-3402.02(a), and that the owner has affirmatively sought information from any applicable former owner in order to make a truthful certification. The Mayor shall investigate all requests for vacancy exemptions under this section and photographically document the vacant status of at least 25% of the total number of randomly selected units in the housing accommodation. All vacancy exemptions shall expire 90 days after certification. Vacancy exemptions properly certified, and in effect, on March 2, 2007, shall expire 90 days after March 2, 2007."</text>
