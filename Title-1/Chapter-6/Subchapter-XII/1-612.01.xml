      <text>"Sec. 2. Furloughing of employees.</text>
      <text>"(a)(1) Notwithstanding any other District law or regulation, and except as provided in subsection (b) of this section and section 3, the personnel authority of each subordinate and independent agency and instrumentality of the District of Columbia government shall furlough each of its full-time employees for 4 legal public holidays without pay during the fiscal year ending September 30, 2011, and each of its part-time employees with a scheduled tour of duty for the appropriate pro-rated amount of furlough hours for the 4 furlough days.</text>
      <text>"(2) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the unpaid furlough days required by this act shall be scheduled on the following legal public holidays, as that term is described in section 1202 of the District of Columbia Government Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act of 1978, effective March 3, 1979 (D.C.

      <text>"(b)(1) Each agency and instrumentality shall furlough each covered employee on the designated legal public holidays, unless doing so:</text>
      <text>"(A) Would impair the ability of the agency or instrumentality to fulfill its essential or emergency public health or public safety functions;</text>
      <text>"(B) Would impair the ability of the agency or instrumentality to fulfill its mission;</text>
      <text>"(C) Is not possible because the holiday is not part of an employee's pay period; or</text>
      <text>"(D) Is not legally permissible.</text>
      <text>"(2) If a covered employee cannot be furloughed on any of the legal public holidays listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section due to any of the reasons listed in paragraph (1) of this subsection, as determined by the Mayor, the employing agency or instrumentality, in consultation with the applicable personnel authority, shall schedule the furlough day on an alternate date in the same pay period that does not impair the ability of the agency or instrumentality to fulfill its mission, as determined by the Mayor. The District of Columbia Public Schools shall not furlough a classroom teacher on a date when there is classroom instruction during an instructional period.</text>
      <text>"(3)(A) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the 4 furlough days required under subsection (a) of this section may be scheduled on alternate dates in the same or subsequent pay periods for covered employees, including correctional officers, working in an agency listed in this paragraph; provided, that each of the covered employees is furloughed the required 4 days by July 31, 2011.

      <text>"(c) To the extent possible, employees who are newly hired after any of the 4 legal public holidays designated as furlough days shall be furloughed during the same pay period of the legal public holiday.</text>
      <text>"(d) Unless a subordinate or independent agency or instrumentality has authority to adopt rules governing furloughs and has adopted such rules, each agency and instrumentality is subject to the furlough rules published at 6 DCMR B §§ 2438 through 2446 and 2499, or emergency rules published by the District of Columbia Department of Human Resources to implement the provisions of this act.</text>
      <text>"(e)(1) Notwithstanding any other District law or regulation, each employee shall be provided not less than 15 days written notice before the employee's first furlough date and the provision of 15 days written notice shall be sufficient notice to permit the furloughing of the employee on that first furlough date.</text>
      <text>"(2) If an employing agency or instrumentality is unable to give notice in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subsection for the unpaid furlough day specified by subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section, or schedule the furlough day as required by this act, the employing agency or instrumentality, in consultation with the applicable personnel authority, shall schedule the furlough day on an alternate date in any subsequent pay period on or before July 31, 2011.</text>
      <text>"Sec. 3. Scope of coverage.</text>
