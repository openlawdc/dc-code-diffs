      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-168 rewrote the section which had read:</text>
      <text>"(a) If within 7 days after the Board certifies the results of an election, any qualified candidate at such election petitions the Board to have the votes cast at such election recounted in 1 or more voting precincts, the Board shall order such recount. In each such case, the petitioner shall deposit a fee of $50 for each precinct petitioned to be recounted. If the total cost of the recount is less than the amount so deposited, the difference shall be refunded. If the total cost of the recount is greater than the deposit, the petitioner shall remit payment for such additional costs within 15 days of receipt of notification from the Board that additional costs have been incurred. If the result of the election is changed as a result of the recount, the entire amount deposited by the petitioner shall be refunded. In no case, however, shall the petitioner be required to pay the cost of any recount in any such election if the difference in the number of votes received by the petitioner in connection with any office and the number of votes received by the person certified as having been elected to that office, in the case of an election from a ward, is less than 1 per centum or 50 votes, whichever is less, or in the case of an election at large, is less than 1 per centum or 350 votes, whichever is less."</text>
      <text>"(b) Within 7 days after the Board certifies the results of an election, any person who voted in the election may petition the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to review such election. In response to such a petition, the Court may set aside the results so certified and declare the true results of the election, or void the election in whole or in part. To determine the true results of an election the Court may order a recount or take other appropriate action, whether or not a recount has been conducted or requested pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The Court shall void an election only for fraud, mistake, the making of expenditures by a candidate, or the willful receipt of contributions in violation of the District of Columbia Campaign Finance Reform and Conflict of Interest Act (§ 1-1101.01 et seq.), or other defect, serious enough to vitiate the election as a fair expression of the will of the registered qualified electors voting therein. If the Court voids an election it may order a special election, which shall be conducted in such manner (comparable to that prescribed for regular elections), and at such time, as the Board shall prescribe. The decision of such Court shall be final and not appealable."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 18-103 rewrote subsec. (a)(1), which had read as follows: "(a)(1) The Board shall recount the votes cast in one or more voting precincts, if within 7 days after the Board certifies the results of an election for an office, a candidate for that office petitions the Board in writing and specifies the precincts in which the recount shall be conducted. The candidate shall deposit a fee of $50 for each precinct included in the recount. If the result of the election is changed as a result of the recount, the fee deposited by the petitioner shall be refunded."</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 20-60 substituted "Delegate to the House of Representatives, Chairman of the Council, member of the Council, Mayor, Attorney General" for "Delegate to the House of Representatives, Mayor, Chairman of the Council, member of the Council" in (a)(2).</text>
