  <text class="centered">MAYOR'S STATEMENT</text>
  <text>Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1988, which would consolidate within the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) functions related to licensing and regulating security officers and private detectives, is the result of several years of planning between the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) and the Metropolitan Police Department. The need for this reorganization grew out of the original rationale for establishing DCRA. This rationale was to create a central location in the District of Columbia to register and license businesses, individuals and activities.</text>
  <text>In DCRA's "One-Stop" center for business licensing, the objective or centralizing the licensure functions could not be achieved for security officers and private detectives because of the various approvals needed from MPD. These approvals and fingerprinting were performed at three separate locations outside of DCRA's offices.</text>
  <text>Now MPD's Security Officers Management Branch is located at the Reeves Center on 14th and U Streets, N.W. Thus, with this reorganization all the licensing functions will be in one location for security officers and private detectives. The reorganization will effectively eliminate the current division of regulatory functions by consolidating these functions within MPD. The result of this consolidation will be to streamline the administration and enforcement of these two business activities. In order to sufficiently carry out these consolidated functions, MPD will augment it's staff by four (4) new clerk positions.</text>
  <text>Finally, this reorganization will affect only those licensing and regulatory functions which are now being performed by DCRA. Functions related to the licensing and regulation of security officers and private detectives now being performed by other Departments will remain in those Departments.</text>
  <text>I stand ready to move forward with this reorganization.</text>
