      <text>In the event any teacher to whom this part applies shall die subsequent to March 6, 1952, after completing at least 18 months of eligible service and is survived by a spouse or domestic partner, such surviving spouse or domestic partner shall be paid an annuity beginning the day after the teacher dies, equal to 55% of the amount of an annuity computed as provided in subsection (a) of § 38-2021.05 with respect to such teacher, except that in the computation of the annuity under such subsection the annuity of the teacher shall be at least the smaller of: (A) forty per centum of his average salary; or (B) the sum obtained under such subsection after increasing his eligible service of the type last performed by the period elapsing between the date of death and the date he would have become 55 years of age. Such annuity and any right thereto shall terminate on the last day of the month before: (A) the surviving spouse or domestic partner dies; or (B) the surviving spouse or domestic partner remarries or enters a new domestic partnership before becoming 55 years of age. In the case of a surviving spouse or domestic partner whose annuity under this paragraph is terminated because of remarriage or entry into a new domestic partnership before becoming 55 years of age, annuity at the same rate shall be restored commencing on the day the remarriage is dissolved by death, annulment, or divorce, or the new domestic partnership is terminated in accordance with § 32-702(d), if:</text>

If such teacher is not survived by a spouse or domestic partner, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smallest of: (A) seventy-five per centum of the teacher's average salary divided by the number of children; (B) $ 1,080; or (C) $ 3,240 divided by the number of children. The child's annuity shall commence on the first day after the teacher dies.

      <heading>Change in Government</heading>
      <text>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</text>
