        <text>Law 19-191 added §§ 8-435 and 8-436 only "upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register, but not before October 1, 2013." As of the most recent updated publication of this section, the certification required for Law 19-191 has not been made. Therefore the sections have not been enacted.</text>
