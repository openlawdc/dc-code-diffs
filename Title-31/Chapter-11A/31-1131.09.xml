        <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
        <text>D.C. Law 17-155 rewrote the section which had read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(a) An individual who applies for an insurance producer license in the District shall not be required to complete any prelicensing education or examination if:</text>
        <text>"(1) The person is currently licensed for the same line of authority in another state; or</text>
        <text>"(2)(A) The application is received within 90 days of the cancellation of the applicant's previous license for the same lines of authority in another state; and</text>
        <text>"(B)(i) The prior state issues a certification that, at the time of cancellation, the person was in good standing in that state; or</text>
        <text>"(ii) The state's producer database records, maintained by the NAIC, its affiliates, or subsidiaries, indicate that the producer is or was licensed in good standing for the line of authority requested.</text>
        <text>"(b) A person licensed as an insurance producer in another state who moves to the District shall make application within 90 days of establishing legal residence to become a resident licensee under 31-1131.06. No prelicensing education or examination shall be required of that person to obtain any line of authority previously held in the prior state unless the Commissioner determines otherwise by regulation.</text>
        <text>"(c) An applicant may apply to the Commissioner to take the examination for a license without any required prelicensing education if the applicant submits proof in a form acceptable to the Commissioner that the individual has attained equivalent knowledge through employment experience. If the Commissioner determines that the employment experience involved the performance of responsible insurance duties in connection with the kind of insurance for which the applicant has applied for a license, the Commissioner may waive such requirement. The applicant shall register for and attain a passing grade on the examination within one year of completion of the required employment experience.</text>
        <text>"(d) The Commissioner may waive the written examination if the applicant for a license as a property and casualty agent and broker furnishes proof to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the applicant has successfully completed:</text>
        <text>"(1) All of the examinations prescribed by the Society of Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriters, Incorporated, and has satisfied all other requirements leading to the degree of a Chartered Property and Casualty Underwriter; or</text>
        <text>"(2) Other private examinations for special competency in property and casualty insurance which the Commissioner determines, by rule, have equivalent requirements and standards.</text>
        <text>"(e) The Commissioner may waive the written examination if the applicant for a license as a life insurance agent or broker furnishes proof to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the applicant has successfully completed:</text>
        <text>"(1) All of the examinations prescribed by the Society of Chartered Life Underwriters of the American College of Life Underwriters, and has satisfied all other requirements leading to the degree of Chartered life Underwriter; or</text>
        <text>"(2) Other private examinations for special competency in life insurance which the Commissioner determines, by rule, to have equivalent requirements and standards."</text>
