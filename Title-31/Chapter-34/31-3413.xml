The deposit shall at all times have a fair market value in an amount of 120% of the HMO's outstanding liability for uncovered expenditures for enrollees in the District, including incurred, but not reported claims, and shall be calculated as of the first day of the month and maintained for the remainder of the month. If a health maintenance organization is not otherwise required to file a quarterly report, it shall file a report within 45 days of the end of the calendar quarter with information sufficient to demonstrate compliance with this section.</text>
