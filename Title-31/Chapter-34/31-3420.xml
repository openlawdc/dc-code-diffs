    <text>Any rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation of a health maintenance organization shall be deemed to be the rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation of an insurance company and shall be conducted under the supervision of the Commissioner pursuant to the law governing the rehabilitation, liquidation, or conservation of insurance companies. The Commissioner may apply for an order directing the Commissioner to rehabilitate, liquidate, or conserve a health maintenance organization upon any one or more grounds set forth in §§ 31-1310 and 31-1315, or when in the Commissioner's opinion the continued operation of a health maintenance organization would be hazardous either to the enrollees or to the people of the District. Enrollees shall have the same priority in the event of liquidation or rehabilitation as the law provides to policyholders of an insurer.</text>
