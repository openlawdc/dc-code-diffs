      <text>The "operative date of § 31-4705.02," referred to in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, was prescribed by § 2 of the Act of October 13, 1962, 76 Stat. 712, Pub. L. 87-738, which was formerly codified as § 35-507(g) (1981 Ed.). Section 35-507 § 31-4705.02, 2001 Ed. was rewritten effective March 14, 1985, and no longer contains the "operative date" language.</text>
