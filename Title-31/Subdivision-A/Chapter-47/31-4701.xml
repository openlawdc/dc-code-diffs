      <text>The Commissioner shall annually value, or cause to be valued, the reserve liabilities (hereinafter called reserves) for all outstanding life insurance policies and annuity and pure endowment contracts of every life insurance company doing business in the District, except that in the case of an alien company such valuation shall be limited to its insurance transactions in the United States, and may certify the amount of any such reserves, specifying the mortality table or tables, rate or rates of interest and methods (net level premium method or other) used in the calculation of such reserves. All such valuations made by him or by his authority shall be made upon the net premium basis. In calculating such reserves, he may use group methods and approximate averages for fractions of a year or otherwise. In lieu of the valuation of the reserves herein required of any foreign or alien company, he may accept any valuation made, or caused to be made, by the insurance supervisory official of any state or other jurisdiction when such valuation complies with the minimum standard herein provided and if the official of such state or jurisdiction accepts as sufficient and valid for all legal purposes the certificate of valuation of the Commissioner when such certificate states the valuation to have been made in a specified manner according to which the aggregate reserves would be at least as large as if they had been computed in the manner prescribed by the law of that state or jurisdiction.</text>

 (2) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates shall be determined according to the equations described in this paragraph, and the results from the equations shall be rounded to the nearest 1/4%. 
 
 (A) For life insurance, the equation for determining the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates is the following:</text>

 <span style="font-style: italic; ">R</span>/2 is the greater of R and .09, 
 
 R is the reference interest rate described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, 
 
 and W is the weighting factor. 
 
 (C) Where cash settlement options are valued on an issue year basis, the formula in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration exceeding 10 years and the formula in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of 10 years or less. 
 
 (D) Where no cash settlement options apply, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply. 
 
 (E) Where cash settlement options are valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall apply. 
 
 (F) (i) If the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies for a calendar year differs from the actual interest rate for similar policies issued in the preceding calendar year by less than 1/2%, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate shall equal the corresponding actual interest rate for the preceding calendar year. 
 
 (ii) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rate shall be determined for each calendar year regardless of when § 31-4705.02(e) becomes operative. 
 
 (3) The weighting factors in the paragraph (2)(A) and (B) of this subsection equations are as follows: 
 
 (A) Weighting factors for life insurance:

 </span>
 10 or less .50 
 
 
 More than 10, but not more than 20 .45

 For life insurance, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values, or both, which are guaranteed in the original policy. 
 
 (B) Weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: .80.
 
 (C) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest contracts shall be specified in the following sub-subparagraphs: 
 
 (i) For purposes of this subsection, the following plan types apply: 
 
 
 "Plan Type A" means that, unless the company prohibits a withdrawal, the policyholder may withdraw funds with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the company received the funds; without adjustment, but in installments for 5 years or more; or as an immediate life annuity. 
 
 
 "Plan Type B" means that, before the interest rate guarantee expires, and unless the company prohibits a withdrawal, the policyholder may withdraw funds with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the company received the funds; without the adjustment, but in installments for 5 years or more; or, after the interest rate guarantee ends, in a lump sum without the adjustment or in installments lasting less than 5 years. 
 
 
 "Plan Type C" means that, before the interest rate guarantee expires, the policyholder may withdraw funds in a lump sum or in installments lasting less than 5 years, and either without the withdrawal being adjusted to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the company received the funds or with the withdrawal subject only to a fixed surrender charge stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.

      <text>Department of Insurance abolished: The Department of Insurance, including the Superintendent, was abolished and the functions thereof transferred to the Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia by Reorganization Plan No. 5 of 1952. Reorganization Order No. 43, dated June 23, 1953, as amended, established, under the direction and control of a Commissioner, a Department of Insurance headed by a Superintendent. The Order provided for the organization of the Department, abolished the previously existing Department of Insurance, and provided that all functions and positions of the previous Department would be transferred to the new Department of Insurance, including the duties, powers, and authorities of all officers and employees; and that all personnel, property, records and unexpended balances relating to the functions and positions transferred would also be transferred to the new Department. The executive functions of the Board of Commissioners were transferred to the Commissioner of the District of Columbia by § 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967. The functions of the Superintendent of Insurance were transferred to the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs by Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1983, effective March 31, 1983. Pursuant to the provisions of D.C. Law 11-268, the Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation was established and the duties of the Superintendent of Insurance and the Insurance Administration were assumed by the Commissioner of Insurance and Securities, and the Insurance Administration in the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs was abolished.</text>

      <heading>Change in Government</heading>
      <text>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to a Board of Commissioners of the District of Columbia (see Acts Relating to the Establishment of the District of Columbia and its Various Forms of Governmental Organization in Volume 1). Section 401 of Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1967 (see Reorganization Plans in Volume 1) transferred all of the functions of the Board of Commissioners under this section to a single Commissioner. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</text>
