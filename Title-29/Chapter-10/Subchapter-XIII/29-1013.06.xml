    <text>If a limited cooperative association is named as or made a party in a derivative proceeding, the association may appoint a special litigation committee to investigate the claims asserted in the proceeding and determine whether pursuing the action is in the best interests of the company. If the association appoints a special litigation committee, on motion by the committee made in the name of the association, except for good cause shown, the court shall stay discovery for the time reasonably necessary to permit the committee to complete its investigation. This subsection does not prevent the court from enforcing a person's right to information under ยง 29-1005.05 or, for good cause shown, granting extraordinary relief in the form of a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction.</text>
