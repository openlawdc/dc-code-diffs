    <text>A nonprofit corporation may, by a provision in its articles of incorporation or bylaws or in a resolution adopted or a contract approved by its board of directors or members, obligate itself in advance of the act or omission giving rise to a proceeding to provide indemnification as permitted by § 29-406.51 or advance funds to pay for or reimburse expenses as permitted by § 29-406.53.

Any such provision that obligates the corporation to provide indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law shall obligate the corporation to advance funds to pay for or reimburse expenses in accordance with § 29-406.53 to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless the provision specifically provides otherwise.</text>
