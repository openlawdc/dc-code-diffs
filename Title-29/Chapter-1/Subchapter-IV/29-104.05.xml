      <text>Section 2(a)(19)(B) of D.C. Law 19-210 provided: "(B) Subsection (b) is amended by striking the phrase 'and other notice and documents' and inserting the phrase ', notices, and demands' in its place." Because this language did not match the statute text of § 29-104.05(b), the amendment could not be implemented.</text>
      <text>Application of Law 19-210: Section 7 of D.C. Law 19-210 provided that the act shall apply as of January 1, 2012.</text>
