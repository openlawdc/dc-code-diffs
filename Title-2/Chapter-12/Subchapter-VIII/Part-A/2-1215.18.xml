In order to request an extension, the BID shall notify the Mayor at least 180 days prior to the end of the BID's term that it desires to extend its status as a registered BID for a 5-year term. The Mayor shall hold such public hearing no earlier than 120 days prior to the end of such fiscal year, and no later than 30 days prior to the end of such fiscal year. If, at the end of the fiscal year, the BID has requested an extension and the Mayor has not issued an order revoking registration or denying an extension, then the BID shall be deemed to be re-registered for a subsequent 5-year term.</text>
