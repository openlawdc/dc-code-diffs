      <text>"(a) The business income of a combined group is determined as follows:</text>
      <text>"(1) From the total income of the combined group as determined under paragraph (2) of this subsection and subsection (b) of this section, subtract any income and add any expense or loss, other than the business income, expense, or loss of the combined group.</text>
      <text>"(2) Except as otherwise provided, the total income of the combined group is the sum of the income of each member of the combined group determined under federal income tax laws, as adjusted for District purposes, as if the member were not consolidated for federal purposes.</text>
      <text>"(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter or the combined reporting regulations, if the combined group includes or any member owns an unincorporated business that would be subject to the tax imposed under ยง 47-1808.03, the income or loss of such unincorporated business shall be apportioned to the District using the apportionment factor of the unincorporated business, and the combined group member- partner's distributive share of such income shall be added to the combined group member- partner's income. A combined group member-partner's distributive share of an unincorporated business's income that was actually taxed under ยง 47-1808.03 shall be subtracted from the combined group member-partner's income.</text>
      <text>"(b) The income of each member of the combined group shall be determined as follows:</text>
      <text>"(1) For any member incorporated in the United States, or included in a consolidated federal corporate income tax return, the income to be included in the total income of the combined group shall be the taxable income for the corporation after making appropriate adjustments under this chapter.</text>

      <text>"(C) Adjustments shall be made to the profit and loss statement to conform it to the tax accounting standards required by this chapter.</text>
      <text>"(D) Except as otherwise provided by regulation, the profit and loss statement of each member of the combined group, and the apportionment factors related thereto, whether United States or foreign, shall be translated into the currency in which the parent company maintains its books and records.</text>
      <text>"(E) Income apportioned to the District shall be expressed in United States dollars.</text>

      <text>"(6)(A) Except as otherwise provided by regulation, business income from an inter-company transaction between members of the same combined group shall be deferred in a manner similar to 26 C.F.R. ยง 1.1502-13.</text>
