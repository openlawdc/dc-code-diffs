      <text>A sale of merchandise to a single customer having a value of $500 or more in any 1-week period shall be considered the sale of a substantial part of the inventory and as 1 transaction unless the sale constitutes the filling of a prescription, or results from a cooperative buying order. If drugs are acquired by such transactions in other jurisdictions, the Mayor shall be notified, and the drugs shall be officially inspected and released by the Mayor prior to sale or other disposition in the District. Bulk quantities of drugs may be transferred only to persons legally entitled to sell or dispense the drugs.</text>
