      <text>D.C. Law 15-38, in subsec. (e), substituted "as an Inspected Sales and Services endorsement to a basic business license under the basic" for "as a Class A Inspected Sales and Services endorsement to a master business license under the master" and "General Sales endorsement to a basic " for "Class B General Sales endorsement to a master".</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 20-50 repealed (d), which read: "When any property has been stolen and sold in the District of Columbia to a dealer under such circumstances that the Mayor of the District of Columbia, after such dealer has been afforded a hearing, is satisfied that such dealer had cause to believe, or could have ascertained by reasonable inquiry or investigation that the property was stolen, and that the dealer did not make reasonable inquiry or investigation as to the title of the seller before making the purchase, the Mayor is authorized and directed to revoke the license of such dealer; and this action shall not be a bar to criminal prosecution for receiving stolen goods; provided, that nothing in this subsection shall be construed as prohibiting the Mayor from suspending or revoking the license of such dealer under the authority contained in § 47-2844."</text>
