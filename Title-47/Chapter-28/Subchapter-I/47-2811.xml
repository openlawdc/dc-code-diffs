      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 15-38, in subsec. (b), substituted "Public Health: Public Accommodations endorsement to a basic business license under the basic" for "Class A Public Health: Public Accommodations endorsement to a master business license under the master".</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 18-88 rewrote subsec. (a), which had read as follows: "(a) Owners or managers of massage establishments and Turkish, Russian, or medicated baths shall pay a license fee of $300 per annum. No license shall be issued under this section without the approval of the Chief of Police. It shall be unlawful for any female to give or administer massage treatment or any bath to any person of the male sex, or for any person of the male sex to give or administer massage treatment or any bath to any person of the female sex, in any establishment licensed under this section. Any person violating the provisions of this section shall, upon conviction, be punished as hereinafter provided in this chapter; and, in addition to such penalty, it shall be the duty of the Mayor of the District of Columbia to revoke the license of the owner or manager of the establishment wherein the provisions of this section shall have been violated."</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-320 repealed (b), which read: "Any license issued pursuant to this section shall be issued as a Public Health: Public Accommodations endorsement to a basic business license under the basic business license system as set forth in subchapter I-A of this chapter."</text>
