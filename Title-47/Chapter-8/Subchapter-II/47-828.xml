        <text>"The 1st section of the Act of March 3, 1881 (§ 47-211)," referred to in this section, appears identical with the original. However, the citation to § 47-211 appears to be erroneous, as that section is based on § 14 of 28 Stat. 285, approved August 14, 1894, rather than the 1881 Act.</text>
