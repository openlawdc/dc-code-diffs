      <text>Board of Public Welfare abolished: See note to § 4-102.</text>
      <text>Statutory provisions for the National Training School for Boys and the National Training School for Girls were formerly codified in Chapters 13 and 14 of Title 44, respectively. These provisions were omitted from codification as obsolete in the 1973 Edition of the D.C. Code. As regards the National Training School for Boys, the School and its functions were transferred to the Department of Justice by Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1939. The School was operated until May 15, 1968, when it was closed pursuant to an order of the Attorney General. As regards the National Training School for Girls, the Act of August 3, 1951, 62 Stat. 154, ch. 291, § 1, provided that no new commitments to the School should be made after August 3, 1951.</text>
