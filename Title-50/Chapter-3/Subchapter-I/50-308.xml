      <heading>Editor's Notes</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 19-184, effective October 22, 2012, repealed this section subject to the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register. As of April 1, 2013, this certification has not occurred; therefore the repeal has not been implemented.</text>
