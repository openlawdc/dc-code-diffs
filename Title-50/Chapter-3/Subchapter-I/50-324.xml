        <heading>Miscellaneous Notes</heading>
        <text>Short title: Section 6051 of D.C. Law 17-20 provided that subtitle F of title VI of the act may be cited as the "Wheelchair-Accessible Taxicab Promotion Fund Act of 2007".</text>
        <text>Law 19-184 amended this section and added §§ 50-325 to 50-329.03 only "upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register." As of the most recent updated publication of this section, the certification required for Law 19-184 has not been made. Therefore the amendments have not been incorporated into this section and the sections have not been added.</text>
