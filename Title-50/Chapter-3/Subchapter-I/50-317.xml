    <text>Within 12 months of March 25, 1986, and at least once every 24 months thereafter, the Commission's Panel on Rates and Rules shall undertake a review of the taxicab rate structure.

Within 120 days of holding the public hearings, the panel shall render a decision on whether a modification or adjustment in rate structure is warranted, and, if determined to be warranted, shall implement the modification or adjustment.</text>

    <text>The panel and the full commission, in the establishment and supervision of the taxicab rate structure, shall balance equitably the interest of owners and operators of taxicabs, taxicab companies and associations, and dispatch services in procuring a maximum rate of return on investment and labor against the public interest in maintaining a taxicab system affordable to a broad cross section of the public, and shall establish nondiscriminatory rates, charges, matrices, boundaries, and methodologies for the determination of taxicab fares which assure reasonable and adequate compensation and promote broad and nondiscriminatory public access to taxicab transportation facilities.</text>

        <text>Law 19-184 amended this section only "upon the inclusion of its fiscal effect in an approved budget and financial plan, as certified by the Chief Financial Officer to the Budget Director of the Council in a certification published by the Council in the District of Columbia Register." As of the most recent updated publication of this section, the certification required for Law 19-184 has not been made. Therefore the amendments have not been incorporated into this section.</text>
