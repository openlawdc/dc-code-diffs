      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-212 rewrote subsec. (a) which had read as follows: "(a) Any individual who violates any provision of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of $55, and the violation shall be processed and adjudicated under the provisions applicable to parking, standing, stopping, and pedestrian infractions which are set forth in subchapter III of Chapter 23 of this title."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-279, in subsec. (a)(2), substituted "as moving violations" for "under the provisions applicable to parking, standing, stopping, and pedestrian infractions which are set forth in subchapter III of Chapter 23 of this title".</text>
