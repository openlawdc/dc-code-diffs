        <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
        <text>D.C. Law 16-195 rewrote the section which had read as follows:</text>
        <text>"If as a result of the operation of a vehicle, any person is tried in any court of competent jurisdiction within the District of Columbia for operating such vehicle while under the influence of any intoxicating liquor or while the ability to operate a vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor in violation of § 50-2201.05(b), negligent homicide in violation of § 50-2203.01, or manslaughter committed in the operation of such vehicle in violation of § 22-2105 and in the course of such trial there is received in evidence, based upon a chemical test, competent proof to the effect that at the time of such operation:</text>
        <text>"(1) Defendant's blood contained less than .03%, by weight, of alcohol, or defendant's urine contained less than .04%, by weight, of alcohol, or that at the time of the test less than .14 micrograms of alcohol were contained in 1 milliliter of his or her breath, consisting of substantially alveolar air, this evidence shall not establish a presumption that the defendant was or was not, at the time, under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but it may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor; and</text>
        <text>"(2) Defendant's blood contained .05 or more, by weight, of alcohol, or defendant's urine contained .06% or more, by weight, of alcohol, or that at the time of the test, .24 micrograms or more of alcohol were contained in 1 milliliter of his or her breath, consisting of substantially alveolar air, this evidence shall constitute prima facie proof that the defendant was, at the time, under the influence of intoxicating liquor and that, while the defendant was operating or in physical control of a vehicle, his or her ability to operate a vehicle was impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 18-88, in par. (1), substituted "less than 0.05 grams" for "0.05 grams or less"; and rewrote par. (2), which had read as follows:</text>
        <text>"(2) Shall not, if at the time of testing, defendant's alcohol concentration was more than 0.05 grams per 100 milliliters of blood or per 210 liters of breath or more than 0.06 grams per 100 milliliters of urine, but less than 0.08 grams per 100 milliliters of blood or per 210 liters of breath or less than 0.10 grams per 100 milliliters of urine, establish a presumption that the defendant was or was not, at the time, under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but it may be considered with other competent evidence in determining whether the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor."</text>
