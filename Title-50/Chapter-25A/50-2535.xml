        <text>"(c) If a performance parking pilot zone is not meeting established parking management targets after the 2nd quarter of operation, DDOT shall re-evaluate the strategies used and implement a revised plan. Within 30 days after the 2nd quarter of operation, any revised plan shall be implemented and transmitted to the Council and ANCs, pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</text>
        <text>"(d) The Mayor shall submit an annual report for the prior fiscal year on each performance parking pilot zone.
