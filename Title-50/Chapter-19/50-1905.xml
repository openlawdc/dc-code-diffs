    <text>If a person under arrest refuses to submit to chemical testing as provided in § 50-1902(a) he shall be informed that failure to submit to such test will result in the revocation of his license or privilege to drive in the District of Columbia if the person is a nonresident. If such person, after having been so informed, still refuses to submit to chemical testing, no test shall be given, but the Mayor, upon receipt of a sworn report of the police officer that he had reasonable grounds to believe the arrested person had been driving or was in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon the public highways while the person's alcohol concentration is 0.08 grams of more either per 100 milliliters of blood or per 210 liters of breath or is 0.10 grams or more per 100 milliliters of urine, or while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or any combination thereof, or while the person's ability to operate a motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor, or while that persons's blood, urine, or breath contains any measurable amount of alcohol if the person is under 21 years of age, and that the person had refused to submit to the 2 tests, shall revoke his license or privilege to drive in the District of Columbia if the person is a nonresident for a period of 12 months; or if the person is without a license to operate a motor vehicle in the District, the Mayor shall deny to the person the issuance of a license for a period of 12 months after the date of the alleged violation, subject to review as hereinafter provided.</text>

    <text>Any person who is unconscious, or who is otherwise in a condition rendering him incapable of refusal, shall be deemed not to have withdrawn the consent provided by § 50-1902 and the 2 tests may be given; except, that if such person thereafter objects to the use of the evidence so secured, such evidence shall not be used and the license or privilege to drive in the District of Columbia of such person shall be revoked, or, if he is without a license, no license shall be issued to him for a period of 12 months.</text>

    <text>If the person under arrest refuses to submit to the test, or subsequently exercises the right to object to the use of the test results pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, evidence of such refusal shall be admissible in any civil or criminal proceeding arising as a result of the acts alleged to have been committed by the person prior to the arrest.</text>

        <heading>Change in Government</heading>
        <text>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.13(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</text>
