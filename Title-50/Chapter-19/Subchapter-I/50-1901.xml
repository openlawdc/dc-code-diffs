      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-235 rewrote par. (8) which had read as follows: "(8) The term 'motor vehicle' means all vehicles propelled by internal-combustion engines, electricity, or steam. The term 'motor vehicle' shall not include battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 15-105, in par. (8), validated a previously made technical correction.</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-224, in par. (8), revived the provisions of D.C. Law 14-235 that expired on October 1, 2005, and substituted "personal mobility devices, as defined by § 50-2201.02(12), or a battery-operated wheelchair when operated by a person with a disability" for "electric personal assistive mobility devices, as defined by § 50-2201.02(12), and battery-operated wheelchairs when operated by a handicapped person at speeds not exceeding 10 miles per hour".</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-305, in par. (8), purported to substitute "person with a disability" for "handicapped person".</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-266 rewrote this section.</text>

      <text>This section originated at a time when local government powers were delegated to the District of Columbia Council and to a Commissioner of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia Self-Government and Governmental Reorganization Act, 87 Stat. 818, § 711 (D.C. Code, § 1-207.11), abolished the District of Columbia Council and the Office of Commissioner of the District of Columbia. These branches of government were replaced by the Council of the District of Columbia and the Office of Mayor of the District of Columbia, respectively. Accordingly, and also pursuant to § 714(a) of such Act (D.C. Code, § 1-207.14(a)), appropriate changes in terminology were made in this section.</text>
