    <text>A shared responsibility agreements represents a tool for ALRs to recognize an individual resident's right to autonomy by respecting his or her right to make individual decisions regarding lifestyle, personal behavior, and ISPs.

In such instances the ALR shall:</text>

      <text>Explain to the resident, or surrogate, why the decision or action may pose risks and suggest alternatives to the resident; and</text>

      <num>(2)</num>
      <text>Discuss with the resident, or surrogate, how the ALR might mitigate potential risks.</text>
