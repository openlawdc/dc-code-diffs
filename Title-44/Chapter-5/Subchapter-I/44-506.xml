      <heading>Editor's Notes</heading>
      <text>Because of the enactment of subchapter II of this chapter by D.C. Law 12-238 and the designation of the preexisting text as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "act" twice near the end of (b).</text>
      <text>Section 112 of D.C. Law 19-171 amended subsection (e) of this section by striking the phrase "with § 44-504(a)(3)" and inserting the phrase "with section 8(a)(3) [of D.C. Law 5-48]" in its place. The legislative intent was to substitute in the phrase "with section 5(a)(3)," codified as § 44-504(a)(3), rather than the phrase "with section 8(a)(3)," and has been implemented accordingly.</text>
