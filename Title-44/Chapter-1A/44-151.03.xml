    <text>If there is good cause to believe that the provider is guilty of a violation for which revocation could be ordered, the Commissioner may first issue a cease and desist order. The cease and desist order shall be subject to notice and hearing within 10 days of the order. If the cease and desist order is not or cannot be effective in remedying the violation, the Commissioner may, after notice and hearing, issue an order that the license be revoked and surrendered. The provider may accept new applicant funds while the revocation order is under appeal provided the funds are escrowed pending results of the appeal.</text>
