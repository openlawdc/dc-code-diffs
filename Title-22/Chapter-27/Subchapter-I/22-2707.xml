      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-306 rewrote the section, which had previously read as follows: "Any person who, within the District of Columbia, shall receive any money or other valuable thing for or on account of arranging for or causing any individual to have sexual intercourse with any other person or to engage in prostitution, debauchery, or any other immoral act, shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than 5 years and a fine of not more than $1,000."</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-317 substituted "not more than the amount set forth in § 22-3571.01" for "not more than $5,000" in (b)(1), and for "not more than $20,000" in (b)(2).</text>
