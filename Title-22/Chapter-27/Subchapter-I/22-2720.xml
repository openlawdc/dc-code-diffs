The assessment of said tax shall be made by the Director of the Department of Finance and Revenue of the District of Columbia and shall be made within 3 months from the date of the granting of the permanent injunction. In case the Director fails or neglects to make said assessment the same shall be made by the Chief of Police, and a return of said assessment shall be made to the Collector of Taxes. Said tax shall be a perpetual lien upon all property, both personal and real used for the purpose of maintaining said nuisance, and the payment of said tax shall not relieve the person or building from any other penalties provided by law.
