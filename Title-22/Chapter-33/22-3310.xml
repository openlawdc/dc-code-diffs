      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 13-314 substituted "$500" for "$50".</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-309 rewrote the section which had read as follows: "It shall not be lawful for any person or persons to girdle, break, wound, destroy, or in any manner injure any of the trees growing or planted and set, or which may hereafter be planted and set on any of the public grounds, open space, or squares or on any private lot, or on any of the streets, or avenues, roads or highways, in the District of Columbia, or any of the boxes, stakes, or any other protection thereof, under a penalty of not exceeding $500 for each and every such offense; and if any person or persons shall tie or in any manner fasten a horse or horses to any of the trees, boxes, or other protection thereof on any streets or avenues, roads, or highways, on any of the public grounds belonging to the United States, or on any of the streets, avenues, or alleys, in the District of Columbia, each and every such offender shall forfeit and pay for each offense a sum not exceeding $10."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 15-354, in subsecs. (a) and (b), validated a previously made technical correction.</text>
      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-317 substituted "a fine of not more than the amount set forth in § 22-3571.01" for "$15,000" in (1), and for "$5,000" in (2).</text>
