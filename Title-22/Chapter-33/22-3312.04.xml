      <text>D.C. Law 13-309 rewrote the section which had read:</text>
      <text>"(a) Any person who violates any provision of § 22-3312.01 shall be fined not less than $250 or more than $5,000, or imprisoned for a period not to exceed 1 year, or both.</text>

      <text>The 2013 amendment by D.C. Law 19-317 substituted "and not more than the amount set forth in § 22-3571.01" for "or more than $1,000" in (a); and substituted "not more than the amount set forth in § 22-3571.01" for "not to exceed $500" in (b).</text>
