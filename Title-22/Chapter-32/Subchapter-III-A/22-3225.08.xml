      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-254 repealed subsec. (e) which had read:</text>
      <text>"(e) No person shall be subject to civil liability for any cause of action, or subject to criminal prosecution, for reporting any suspected insurance fraud if:</text>
      <text>"(1) The report was made to the Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation, the Metropolitan Police Department, or any other law enforcement authority, or to any insurer, insurance agent, or other person who collects, reviews, or analyzes information concerning insurance fraud, by any individual or entity suspecting insurance fraud; and</text>
      <text>"(2) The person or entity reporting the suspected fraud acted without malice when making the report."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 15-166, in subsecs. (a) and (d), substituted "Department of Insurance, Securities, and Banking" for "Department of Insurance and Securities Regulation".</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 16-191 validated a previously made technical correction in the directory language of D.C. Law 15-166 which required no change in text.</text>
