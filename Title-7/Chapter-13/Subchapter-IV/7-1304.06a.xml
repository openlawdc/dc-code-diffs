    <text>The individual found incompetent in a criminal case shall have the right to be present during the trial or hearings and to testify, but shall not be compelled to testify, and shall be so advised by the Court.

    <text>If the Court or jury finds that the individual does not have an intellectual disability or that the individual is not likely to cause injury to others as a result of the individual's intellectual disability if allowed to remain at liberty, the Court shall dismiss the petition. If the Court or jury finds that the individual has an intellectual disability and is likely to cause injury to others as a result of the individual's intellectual disability if allowed to remain at liberty, the Court shall order commitment to DDS for placement in a facility that would be the least restrictive means of providing the habilitation indicated by the individual habilitation plan required under § 7-1304.03 and of preventing the individual from causing injury to others as a result of the individual's intellectual disability.</text>
