      <text>Any person who is aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, or who is acting on or in behalf of a person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter, may maintain an action in court to enjoin the continuation of that violation or the commission of any future violation.

Should such a finding be made, days on which, in the opinion of the court, the services provided were grossly inadequate shall not be counted against the 90-day limitation in § 7-1905(a)(2). Actions brought under this paragraph shall, commensurate with the exigency of the circumstances alleged, be expedited pursuant to procedures to be established by the court.</text>
