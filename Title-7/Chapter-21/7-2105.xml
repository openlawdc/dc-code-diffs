      <text>To ensure that each new facility will be in compliance with this chapter, the rules issued pursuant to this chapter, and all other applicable laws, the Mayor shall conduct an on-site inspection before a facility's initial licensure. Instead of issuing a full-year license to a new facility or licensee, the Mayor may issue a provisional license under § 7-2107(b) pending satisfactory completion of additional, follow-up inspections. After initial licensure, the Mayor shall conduct at least 1 on-site inspection before each licensure renewal.</text>

      <text>The Mayor shall at least once a year inspect all facilities caring for District children outside the District to ensure that each of these facilities is in substantial compliance with this chapter, the rules issued pursuant to this chapter, and all other applicable laws. One year after the issuance of rules under § 7-2103, the Mayor shall report to the Council on the cost and efficacy of implementing this paragraph and on the extent to which facilities caring for District children outside the District are required by their respective jurisdictions to meet licensure standards comparable to those adopted under § 7-2103. Within 45 days after receiving the Mayor's report, the Council shall determine whether this paragraph should be amended to authorize the Mayor to accept licensure by other jurisdictions in lieu of conducting annual inspections.</text>
