      <heading>Effect of Amendments</heading>
      <text>D.C. Law 14-28 substituted "ABRA Fund" for "ABRA Account" in subsec. (b); and rewrote subsec. (a) which had read as follows: "(a) There is established within the General Fund of the District of Columbia an account designated as the Alcoholic Beverage Regulation Administration Account, to which all funds obtained from alcoholic beverage taxes and licensing and permitting fees shall be credited. Any monies deposited in the ABRA Account but not expended in a fiscal year shall be returned to the General Fund. Subject to the applicable laws relating to the appropriation of District funds, monies received and credited to the ABRA Account shall be used to fund the expenses of ABRA in the discharge of its administrative and regulatory duties. Funds obtained from penalties and fines, as prescribed by Chapter 8, shall be credited to the General Fund."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 15-105, in subsec. (a), validated a previously made technical correction.</text>
