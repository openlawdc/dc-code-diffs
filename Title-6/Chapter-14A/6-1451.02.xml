        <text>"(a-1)(1) Beginning 90 days after October 22, 2008, 10 buildings owned or operated by the District of Columbia shall be benchmarked using the Energy Star® Portfolio Manager benchmarking tool, and the results made available to the public on the Internet through the DDOE website.</text>

Benchmark and Energy Star® statements of energy performance for each building shall, within 60 days of being generated, be made available to DDOE, which shall then make them accessible to the public via an online database.</text>
        <text>"(b)(1) A nonresidential project shall:</text>
        <text>"(A)(i) Be designed to achieve 75 points on the EPA national energy performance rating system as determined by the ENERGY STAR Target Finder Tool and be benchmarked annually using the ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager benchmarking tool; provided, that the building has 10,000 square feet of gross floor area or more and is of a building type for which ENERGY STAR tools are available.</text>
        <text>"(ii) Renovated buildings shall be exempt from the Target Finder requirement. Benchmark and Target Finder scores and ENERGY STAR statements of energy performance for each building shall be made available to the general public within 60 days after they are generated;</text>

        <text>"(c) A residential project with 10,000 square feet of gross floor area or more shall fulfill or exceed the Green Communities 2006 standard or a substantially equivalent standard. All such projects shall submit a copy of the Green Communities Self Certification Check List and verification of meeting Green Communities requirements for energy efficiency to the Department as part of the application for a certificate of occupancy.</text>
        <text>"(d) On or before October 1, 2008, each tenant of a building that has a certificate of occupancy for a commercial use and that improves District-owned or District instrumentality-owned building space of at least 30,000 square feet gross floor area or more, with an improvement that requires comprehensive construction or alteration of partitions, electrical systems, HVAC &amp; R, and finishes, shall obtain a verification that the improved building space fulfills or exceeds the LEED-CI 2.0 standard at the certification level."</text>
        <text>D.C. Law 19-139 rewrote subsec. (a)(1); in subsec. (a)(2)(A), designated the existing text as sub-subpar. (i) and added sub-subpar. (ii); added subsecs. (a)(5) and (6); and, in subsec.

        <text>"(a)(1) This subsection shall apply to all new construction and substantial improvement of District-owned or financed, and District instrumentality-owned and financed, projects if 15% or more of a project's total project cost was financed by the District or a District instrumentality."</text>
