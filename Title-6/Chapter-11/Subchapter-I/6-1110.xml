      <text>Because of the codification of D.C. Law 5-69 as subchapter II of this chapter, and the designation of the preexisting text of Chapter 11 as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "chapter," where applicable, in this section.</text>
      <text>Applicability: Section 4 of D.C. Law 16-189 provided: "The implementation of the provisions of this act is subject to appropriations and nothing in this act shall be construed to create an entitlement."</text>
