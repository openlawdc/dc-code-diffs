      <text>Because of the codification of D.C. Law 5-69 as subchapter II of this chapter, and the designation of the preexisting text of Chapter 11 as subchapter I, "subchapter" has been substituted for "chapter," where applicable, in this section.</text>
      <text>Section 20(c) of D.C. Law 13-313, amends D.C. Law 13-172 by adding a new section 403a which provided:</text>
      <text>"Sec. 403a. Applicability. Section 403(a) and (b)(1)(A) and (B) shall app only prospectively to hearings held by the Mayor or the Historic Preservation Board after the effective date of this title."</text>
