  <heading>Exemption by Mayor.</heading>
  <text>The Mayor of the District of Columbia, or his designee, may grant an exemption from the provisions of § 6-731.01 in the event he, or his designee, inspects a housing accommodation wherein there are unvacated units subject to a notice to vacate and finds that a proposed alteration, while it may cause such a rental unit to come to be in substantial violation (or, if already in substantial violation, to be in greater violation) of the housing regulations of the District of Columbia for a period of time in excess of 24 hours, is, nevertheless, necessary for the immediate safety of the habitants of the accommodation.</text>
