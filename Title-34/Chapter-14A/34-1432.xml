      <text>D.C. Law 18-223 rewrote subsec. (e), which had read as follows: "(e) Subject to subsections (a) and (c) of this section, an electricity supplier shall meet the solar requirement by obtaining the equivalent amount of renewable energy credits from solar energy systems interconnected to the distribution grid serving the District of Columbia. Only after an electricity supplier exhausts all opportunity to meet this requirement that the solar energy systems be connected to the grid within the District of Columbia, can that supplier obtain renewable energy credits from jurisdictions outside the District of Columbia."</text>
      <text>D.C. Law 19-36 rewrote subsecs. (a-1), (c), and (e).</text>
